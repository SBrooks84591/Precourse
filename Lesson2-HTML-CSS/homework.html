        <span id="spanID">My favorite food is my mom's meatballs and gravy.  Basically, the recipe is ground beef seasoned with onion powder, garlic power, salt, pepper, and Lipton Onion Soup mix.  She cooks those in a frying pan. The gravy is your basic roue with chicken stock.  Add some jasmine rice, and you have a bravo meal.  My mom is almost 70, and has arthritis in both knees, so she does not cook a big meal very often, but when she does she puts her foot in it.</span>
